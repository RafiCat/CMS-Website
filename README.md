I created this website for Lehigh University Membrane Research team when I was working as a research assistant at the Im Lab. Although I didn't have(at that time; sophomore in college) any exceptional experience in creating website, Prof. Wonpil Im requested to create a minimalistic website using whatever knowledge I had. I created this simple website using basic HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. Website is hosted at membrane.lehigh.edu . This was created within a very short/tight schedule of time
